# Purpose
All of the templates I can find have all kinds of branding and whatnot in them. I want to be able to throw together a site without remembering how I did it.
Perhaps I'll post it for all someday.

# Goal
To make a super barebones jekyll template without branding and dependencies that may or may not be around forever. The intent is to have a starting point so that I can make quick websites without remembering how I did it.
