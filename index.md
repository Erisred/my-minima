## Minima - my template
This is my take on a minimal Jekyll template. I tried to include all the things I usually need to add when I make a blog site: tags functionality, an about page, a [tag page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024/2024-03-29-tags.md %}), an author page, and some light formatting - although I did my best to keep everything true to the original, because everything after that is subjective. [I documented]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2024/2024-02-20-startup.md %}) the changes I made to the base template for posterity.
