# Starting out (this fails at te last step, I might need to fork instead :( )
Clone the original to local:
- Navigate to the folder to add the repo to and enter the command line there
- Enter `git clone https://github.com/jekyll/minima.git`
  - Mine is `https://github.com/Erisred/my-minima.git`
- Navigate to the files and delete the `.git` file in the root. `minima/.git`
  - If following exactly, just perform `cd minima` to enter the new folder.
- Back to command line - in the newly created project folder - and enter `git init` to rebuild the git file.
  - If following exactly, just perform `cd minima` to enter the new folder.
- Push to your repo (already created, of course!)
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "your commit message"`
  - `git remote add origin <ADDRESS>`
    - *Address* is the url of **your** repo.
    - As in: https://github.com/GITHUB NAME/GITHUB REPO NAME
  - `git push origin main`
- Make the changes as outlined below

# Changes made to the original
I made changes already to the minimal files. I tried to document them all.
- Downloaded the original from [minima-master](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master).
- Added this startup page.
- Removed the minimal gemspec to make the site a little more independent. Change the following in the Gemfile.
  - Comment out the gemspec line to just read `#gemspec`.
  - Then, add `gem "minima", :github => 'jekyll/minima'`
    - For posterity, the resources I used were [Remove the unnecessary](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/#remove-the-unnecessary), an [issue post](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1407) about removing it that proved it was possible, and finally [this blog post](https://urishx.github.io/2020/12/16/Customizing-Jekyll's-default-theme.html) that gave the final clues.
- Changed the links so the color is the same as text, and swapped the underline to be on normally, but disappear when hovering.
- When serving the site to localhost, if a webrick error presents, run the following on the CLI: `bundle add webrick`. This adds the necessary webrick to the gemfile. **Hella important!**
- Added all of the variables I could find to the `custom-variables` file. They have been commented out for now. The default variables are controlled via the minima gem, but can be overridden using this file.
- Hosted on Github for version control.

# Purpose
All of the templates I can find have all kinds of branding and whatnot in them. I want to be able to throw together a site without remembering how I did it.
Perhaps I'll post it for all someday.

# Goal
To make a super barebones jekyll template without branding and dependencies that may or may not be around forever. The intent is to have a starting point so that I can make quick websites without remembering how I did it.


## Started
- Check out theming
  - Starting point was finding the variables.
  - The `config.yml` file can be amended to use one of five prebuilt themes from minima. This is likely how I will create my own themes.
    - Change the minima: skin: from classic to what you'd like.
- Make sure the Discus code works, and is easy to toggle.
  - Closer, per [this post](https://cuda-chen.github.io/blogging/2020/03/28/add-Disqus-to-Jekyll-Minima-theme-simplified.html) and bolstered by [this issue](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/issues/104), but I'm still not there. Do I need a DQ account to make it work?

## Roadmap
- Make google analytics work/possible - like most other templates do. They usually just need an include section and an account key entered into the config.yml file.
- Change all css to variables so theming can be simplified.
- Seriously consider adding and/or simplifying a dark/light mode theme switcher. I have a dead simple one on another site that should serve as a template.
- ~~Put this on GitHub so I can work on it everywhere.~~
- Find and remove all the fluff, including the test posts. Leave this one and one more with all the markdowny-things to help with theme styling.
