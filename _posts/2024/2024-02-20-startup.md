# Starting out (this fails at te last step, I might need to fork instead :( )
Clone the original to local:
- Navigate to the folder to add the repo to and enter the command line there
- Enter `git clone https://github.com/jekyll/minima.git`
  - Mine is `https://github.com/Erisred/minima-template.git`
- Navigate to the files and delete the `.git` file in the root. `minima/.git`
  - If following exactly, just perform `cd minima` to enter the new folder.
- Back to command line - in the newly created project folder - and enter `git init` to rebuild the git file.
- Push to your repo (already created, of course!)
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "your commit message"`
  - `git remote add origin <address>`
    - *Address* is the url of **your** repo.
  - `git push origin main`
- Make the changes as outlined below

# Purpose
All of the templates I can find have all kinds of branding and whatnot in them. I want to be able to throw together a site without remembering how I did it.
Perhaps I'll post it for all someday.

# Goal
To make a super barebones jekyll template without branding and dependencies that may or may not be around forever. The intent is to have a starting point so that I can make quick websites without remembering how I did it.

## Done
- Download zip of the original at [minima-master](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master).
- Start this page.
- Figured out the Gemspec thing. Make these changes to the Gemfile:
  - Need to comment out the gemspec line to just read `#gemspec`.
  - Then, add `gem "minima", :github => 'jekyll/minima'`
  - That's it!
  -  For posterity, the resources I used were [Remove the unnecessary](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/#remove-the-unnecessary), an [issue post](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/1407) about removing it that proved it was possible, and finally [this blog post](https://urishx.github.io/2020/12/16/Customizing-Jekyll's-default-theme.html) that gave the final clues.
  -  Changed the links so the color is the same as text, and swapped the underline to be on normally, but disappear when hovering.
  -  I never mention that I need to run the `bundle add webrick` to kill the strange webrick error when running the localhost server. **Hella important!**

## Next steps
- Check out theming
- Make sure the Discus code works, and is easy to toggle.
  - Closer, per [this post](https://cuda-chen.github.io/blogging/2020/03/28/add-Disqus-to-Jekyll-Minima-theme-simplified.html) and bolstered by [this issue](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/issues/104), but I'm still not there. Do I need a DQ account to make it work?

## Roadmap
- Make google analytics work/possible - like most other templates do. They usually just need an include section and an account key entered into the config.yml file.
- Change all css to variables so theming can be simplified.
- Seriously consider adding and/or simplifying a dark/light mode theme switcher. I have a dead simple one on another site that should serve as a template.
- Put this on GitHub so I can work on it everywhere.
- Find and remove all the fluff, including the test posts. Leave this one and one more with all the markdowny-things to help with theme styling.
