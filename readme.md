# Purpose
All of the templates I can find have all kinds of branding and whatnot in them. I want to be able to throw together a site without remembering how I did it.
Perhaps I'll post it for all someday.

# Goal
To make a super barebones jekyll template without branding and dependencies that may or may not be around forever. The intent is to have a starting point so that I can make quick websites without remembering how I did it.

## Done
- Download zip of the original at [minima-master](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master).
- Start this page.
- Figured out the Gemspec thing. Make these changes to the Gemfile:
  - Need to comment out the gemspec line to just read `#gemspec`.
